 Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
   Hint #1  
In-place means we should not be allocating any space for extra array. But we are allowed to modify the existing array. However, as a first step, try coming up with a solution that makes use of additional space. For this problem as well, first apply the idea discussed using an additional array and the in-place solution will pop up eventually.
  Hint #2  
A two-pointer approach could be helpful here. The idea would be to have one pointer for iterating the array and another pointer that just works on the non-zero elements of the array.


Solution

class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
    int index =0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]!=0){
                nums[index++] =nums[i];
            }
        }
        for(int i =index;i<nums.length;i++){
            nums[i] =0;
        }
    }
}
